# OpenCI

Our vision is to bring our diverse open source communities together by facilitating the communication between us and our integration, deployment, delivery, and automation. We strive to involve others who share similar concerns as us and want to solve the challenges we all face in a collaborative manner. 

If you are interested in participating in this effort, please use the collaboration tools/communication channels listed towards the end of the page to get in touch with all of the OpenCI contributors.

## Cross-Community Needs

OpenCI is Cross {Community,Project,Foundation} CICD/Infra initiative.

* Community maintained per project metadata
    * commit sha,tag => CI Jobs => CI Artifacts
    * commit tag => Release Artifacts
    * Possibly Similar to [landscape.cncf.io](https://landscape.cncf.io) data
* Event Driven CI
    * PubSub notification of XCI events
    * upon creation of upstream tag + artifact, trigger CI
    * upon failure of test with artifacts, publish failure
* Immutable history of shared artifacts/results
    * IPFS style artifact storage with metadata

### Cross-Community Themes

During the inaugural Cross Community CI/CD and Infra Workshop, participants identified the themes below as the first items to start working on together in a collaborative manner. 

* Vocabulary, Use Cases, Considerations, Constraints
    * Wavell Watson/CNCF, Monty Taylor/OpenStack, Andrew Grimberg/LF
* Integrating CIs/Event Driven CI
    * Daniel Farrell/OpenDaylight, Fatih Degirmenci/OPNFV
* Means and Types of Feedback, Dashboard/Visualization
    * Taylor Carpenter/CNCF, Maciek Konstantynowicz/fd.io, Ed Kern/fd.io
* Cross Community Test Strategy
    * Georg Kunz/OPNFV, Hippie Hacker/CNCF
* Security
